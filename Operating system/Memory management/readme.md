### Internal fragmentation

When a piece of allocated memory leaves some unused space.<br>
Ex) When a piece memory whose size is 10bytes has 8bytes of data, leaving 2 bytes unused
### External framentation

When memory space between pieces of allocated memory is unavailable.

# Contiguous memory allocation
In **contiguous memory allocation**, the whole process is allocated to a contiguous partition of memory.
## Fixed(or static) partitioning
This is the oldest and simplest. The size of a partition is fixed in RAM when allocated, which can cause big internal fragmentation.

## Variable(or dynamic) partitioning
The partition size varies according to the need of the process, which can cause big external fragmentation.
### Initial memory state

### First fit

The partition is allocated which is first sufficient from the top of memory. The OS doesnâ€™t search for the best partition but just the first partition available with a sufficient size.<br>
* It is fast in processing but can waste a lot of memory.

### Best fit

The entire list of free partitions is searched and the smallest adequate hole is allocated.
* Slower process than First fit.
* The minimum possible space in the memory is allocated, making memory management efficient. To save memory from getting wasted, it is the best method.

### Worst fit

The entire list of free partitions is searched and the biggest hole possible is allocated.

# Non-contiguous memory allocation
Non-contiguous memory allocation is a method of storing data in multiple memory locations rather than in a single contiguous block.
### Techniques
- Paging: Divides a process's memory space into fixed-size blocks called pages. Each process is divided into pages of the same size, which can be stored anywhere in the physical memory.
- Segmentation: Divides a process's memory space into different segments, where each segment represents a specific type of data or code (e.g., code segment, data segment, stack segment). They can be non-contiguously allocated.
### Advantages
- Helps reduce fragmentation since it minimizes wasted space in memory by effectively utilizing small pockets of available memory.
### Challenges
- More complex memory management.
- Overhead of maintaining page tables or segment tables.

# Virtual memory

Virtual memory is a memory management technique that creates an illusion of a very large memory space by using both physical memory (RAM) and a part of secondary storage (like a hard disk).<br>
Virtual memory inherently relies on non-contiguous memory allocation.
### How It Works
The operating system maintains a page table to track which virtual pages are mapped to which physical frames of memory.
When a process accesses data, the virtual memory address is translated to a physical address. If the data is not in RAM, a page fault occurs, and the OS loads the required data from the disk to RAM(page replacement).
### Benefits
- Provides a large address space to processes, irrespective of the actual physical memory available.
### Considerations
- Overhead of page table management.
- Performance can be affected by the paging process, especially if the system frequently accesses data that is not in the main memory (page faults).

## Page replacement
Page replacement refers to a scenario in which a page from the main memory should be replaced by a page from the secondary memory. Page replacement occurs due to page faults.<br>
A Page Fault occurs when a requested page is currently not loaded into the main physical memory.

### page-replacement algorithmss
* **First-In First-Out** : This is the simplest. the oldest page is moved out.
* **Optimal page replacement** : a page that will be used the least is moved out. This reduces page-faults the most theoretically
but it is the problem that such a page is hard to predict.
* **Least-Recently-Used** : exploits the fact that pages that were not used recently have a high probability not to be used constantly.
It reduces page-faults less than the optimal page replacement but is one of the practically best algorithms.

# Memory Management Unit

The MMU, or Memory Management Unit is primarily responsible for handling memory access and management.<br>
The MMU is crucial in managing the virtual memory system where both RAM and a portion of the secondary memory are used to create the illusion of a very large memory space.<br>

- ### Memory Translation
The MMU translates virtual memory addresses into physical memory addresses. When a program accesses a memory location, it uses a virtual address, which the MMU maps to the actual physical address in RAM.
- ### Memory Protection
By managing access to memory, the MMU helps ensure that each program operates within its allocated space. This prevents one program from accidentally or maliciously modifying the memory used by another program, enhancing system stability and security.
- ### Paging and Swapping
The MMU facilitates paging, a process where sections of memory (pages) are moved between physical RAM and secondary memory to optimize available RAM usage. When a page is not in physical memory, the MMU can trigger a page fault, leading to page swapping where required data is loaded into RAM from secondary storage.
