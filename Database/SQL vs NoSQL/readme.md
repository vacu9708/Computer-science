- **Pre-defined schemas** are required to store data, which is hard to modify after.
- **Normalized tables** are combined by JOIN clauses, which eliminates risks when updating duplicate data (e.g. updating data and forgetting the duplicate data in one or more tables. e.g. Overhead when updating duplicate data in a table).

# NoSQL

NoSQL prioritizes flexibility, scalability, and performance over strict constraints.<br>
**document** of NoSQL correspondes to **row** of SQL and **collection** of NoSQL correspondes to **table** of SQL.<br>
- Data is stored in **flexible documents** that can have a different structure, which is simpler and improves productivity.
