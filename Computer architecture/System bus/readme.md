A ***system bus*** is a pathway that transmits data between the components of hardware that consists of data bus, address bus, control bus

* **data bus** : A pathway that transfers data between the CPU and other components. 
  It is a bidirectional bus that either transfers the data and instructions of memory and I/O devices to the CPU or
  transfers the operation results of the CPU to memory and I/O devices
* **address bus** : In order to carry data to an exact location, the address of the location has to be set.
  The address bus is a pathway where the CPU transmits memory address to memory or I/O devices, so it is called "unidirectional bus".
  If there are 16 address buses, 2^16=65536 addresses can be distinguished.
* **control bus** : A control bus is a pathway where the CPU transmits control signals to memory or I/O devices.
