# Test Driven Development
## Why TDD is important?
- **Easier bug catching**: TDD helps catch bugs early on when a test fails
- **Confidence in code**: TDD ensures that new code changes do not introduce bugs or break existing functionality.
- **Easier understanding of the code**: Tests written as part of TDD act as documentation for the code. They provide clear examples of how what behavior is expected. This helps other developers understand the codebase more easily and facilitates collaboration within the team.

## Pattern
1. **Given** this data(preconditions)
2. **When** this action is performed
3. **Then** this outcome is expected for the test to pass
