Code changes are committed to git, which triggers an automated build and testing process.<br>
Successful builds are automatically deployed to staging or production environments, further streamlining the software release process.
### Key elements of CI/CD include:
- **Automated Builds**: The CI/CD pipeline automatically builds the codebase after every commit or on a scheduled basis.
- **Automated Testing**: Various types of tests, such as unit tests, integration tests, and stress tests, are executed automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline. This ensures the quality and functionality of the software changes.
- **Continuous Deployment**: Successful builds are automatically deployed to staging or production environments, further streamlining the software release process.
