* **data bus** : A pathway that transfers data between the CPU and other components.<br>
It is a bidirectional bus that either transfers the data and instructions of memory and I/O devices to the CPU or transfers the operation results of the CPU to memory and I/O devices
* **address bus** : In order to carry data to an exact location, the address of the location has to be set.<br>
The address bus is a pathway where the CPU transmits memory address to memory or I/O devices, so it is called "unidirectional bus".<br>
If there are 16 address buses, 2^16=65536 addresses can be distinguished.
* **control bus** : A control bus is a pathway where the CPU transmits control signals to memory or I/O devices.
