**Object Oriented Programming** : 

* What is an object? : An object is an abstract data type that has data and code.
* What is a class? : a class is a blueprint for creating objects.

* **Inheritance** : Inheritance is the procedure in which one class inherits the properties of another class.
To put it simply, inheritance means the use of code that is pre-written.

* **Method overriding** means to override the methods that have the same name as the child's methods.

## 4 characteristics of OOP
* **Polymorphism** : to allow a single interface (such as a name and an operator) to be used for multiple purposes that have the same
meaning.

* **Inheritance** : the procedure in which one class inherits the code of another class. (The inherited class is known as the Parent class)

* **Abstraction** : my understanding -> wrapping something up as a simple name
For example, when there are fish, lions, rabbits, they can be wrapped up as "life". In a code, giving a class a name.
(From the internet : showing only essential attributes of objects and hiding unnecessary details)

* **Encalsulation** :  the wrapping up of data and methods under a single unit. / The bundling of data and methods into one unit.
Another way to think about encapsulation is, it is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield. (Information hiding)
