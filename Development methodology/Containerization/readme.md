# Invention of the container revolutionized the shipping industry
By using containers of a consistent shape, goods could be loaded and unloaded quickly and efficiently, which reduced costs and increased productivity.<br>

# Docker
Docker is a popular containerization platform for packing an application into a portable container that can be run on any system that supports Docker.<br>
## Why use Docker
- ### Portability
  Docker containers can run on any system that supports Docker.<br>
  In software development, environment setup often take a long time and is time-consuming. Docker **eliminates the need for manual environment setup.**<br>
- ### Isolation
  Docker containers ensure that the application in each container runs in its own isolated environment.<br>
  This makes it easier to avoid conflicts between different applications.
   
# Why use Docker instead of Virtual machine
- **VMs** simulate a complete operating system (OS) with their own kernel, which leads to a higher overhead and consumes more memory.
- **Docker**, on the other hand, runs applications within isolated containers that share the host OS kernel. Docker containers consume fewer resources than VMs and are lightweight.
   
# Kubernetes
Kubernetes is a container orchestrator, which means that it is a platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
