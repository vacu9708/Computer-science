The **database key** is an attribute or a group of attributes that can uniquely identify each record in a table.<br>

* **Candidate key** : one or more keys that can uniquely identify rows in a table
Ex) id, email. student_name cannot be a candidate key because there may be a duplication.
* **Primary key** : a key selected among candidate keys
* **Super key** : a subset of keys that can uniquely identify rows in a table and has one or more unnecessary attributes
Ex) id + studnet_name
* **Alternate key** : remaining keys after excluding the primary key
