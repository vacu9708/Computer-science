# Why is cloud computing necessary?
In summary, it is because the infrastructure is delegated to cloud providers.
- **Cost**: The substantial upfront investments in the infrastructure are reduced.
- **Reliability**: Cloud services offer robust disaster recovery mechanisms.
- **Scalability**: All that needs to be done for scaling the server is just require it.
- **Maintenance**: Cloud providers relieve their users of the responsibility for the infrastructure maintenance.
- **Security**: Cloud providers employ advanced security measures to protect their infrastructure.
- **Acessibility**: Cloud services allow their users to access their services from anywhere with an internet connection.

# Serverless
Serverless computing is a part of cloud computing that abstracts away server management(e.g. ubuntu) and allows developers to focus solely on writing and deploying code,<br>
while cloud servers provide virtual machines(e.g. ubuntu) for users to manage and configure their own servers in the cloud.
