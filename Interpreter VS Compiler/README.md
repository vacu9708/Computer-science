Both compilers and interpreters are used to convert a program that translates code written in a high-level language into machine code



### Compiler
* scans the whole program in one go.
* checks the inefficiency of the code and makes the code more efficient automatically(compiler optimization), which allows compiled program to run faster.

### Interpreter
* translates the program one statement at a time, which leads to slower speed.
