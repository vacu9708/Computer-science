Both compilers and interpreters are used to convert a program that translates code written in a high-level language into machine code

### Compiler
* scans the whole program in one go. The whole code is translated into the machine code before program runs 
* checks and fixes the inefficiency of the code being compiled(compiler optimization).
* These things allow compiled program to run faster than interpreted program once it is compiled.

### Interpreter
* translates the program one statement at a time, which means slower speed and difficult optimization.
* If compiled program changes, it has to be compiled to see the change. Compiling takes much more time than interpreting. If the program is big, it might even take more than an hour, which leads to difficult modification. On the other hand interpreted program can be modified much faster.
* Designing a compiler is much more compilcated. This is why more and more interpreted languages are created
