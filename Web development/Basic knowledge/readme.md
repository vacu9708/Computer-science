# Hyperlink
something you can click on to jump to another place of the web. (It creates a nonlinear network of information)

# URI, URL
- URI: A unique string to identify a resource (e.g. www.example.com)
- URL: URI + protocol (e.g. http://www.example.com)

# The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML
the standard markup language that is used to define the structure of a webpage(, which can include hypermedia such as text, graphics, sound, video, and so on).

# HTTP and HTTPs
- **HTTP**: a stateless, insecure protocol for a client and a server to communicate, comprised of a request and a response.
- **HTTPs**: HTTP that is encrypted using SSL handshake. It is secure but delays the speed of the website.

# HTTP methods
- **GET** for retrieving a resource
- **POST** for creating a new resource
- **PUT** for updating a resource
- **DELETE** for deleting a resource

# API
- An API allows different software applications to communicate.
- An open API is an API publicly available.
- An OpenAPI is a specification for describing RESTful APIs, which allows for the automatic generation of code, documentation, and tests based on the API specification.

# RESTful API
APIs that obey the REST constraints are described as RESTful API.<br>
Server side framework can be just about anything thanks to RESTful API that abstracts the implementation.
## REST constraints
- **Self-descriptive**: RESTful APIs has to contain enough information that represents what it does.
- **Stateless**: Any client state is not maintain.
- **Uniform interface**: RESTful APIs have a uniform interface that provides a standardized way for clients and servers to communicate.<br>
The uniform interface constraint includes several aspects, such as:<br>
- **Resource identification**: APIs are identified by unique URIs.
- **Resource manipulation**: HTTP methods that have a specific meaning (GET, POST, etc.) are used.
- **Representation of resources**: Resources are represented in a standardized format (e.g., JSON, XML) that both the client and server understand.
